<h2>The Beginning</h2>
XOPBOT.inc is an multiregion company mostly dedicated to developing discord bot's and websites.<br/>XOPBOT.inc was founded on june 28 2021 as a company although the discord bot itself was created on april 14 2021, it's founders were the brothers <a href="https://instagram.com/brandon.torreglosa">Brandon Torreglosa</a> and <a href="https://about:blank">Esteban Torreglosa</a> that made it for fun purposes and just to have a laugh. But some time later the co-founder left as the CEO and discontinued the bot developing, with results on march 15 2021 the company to be acquired by a low level company named <code>APULL.Inc</code> who had as CEO the first founder and owned 50% of the company's rights and had desicions in updates and more.

<h2>Growth And Products</h2>
After XOPBOT.inc was acquired by <code>APULL.Inc</code> the company started itself showing massive participation in expanding the bot development and making the bot more popular and it started with the web app of the bot. The first domain created by <code>APULL.Inc</code> for the company was the famous <a href="https://xopbot.glitch.me">xopbot-gg.glitch.me</a> domain that achieved great success and profited to <code>APULL.Inc</code> over 300$ in the first three months by the website advertisements, but sadly these advertisements contained 18+ sometimes content since it came from third party service leading the domain to be suspended and resulting the company to make a new domains that are not longer useable: <a href="https://xopbot.glitch.me/">www.xopbot.tk</a> and <a href="https://xopbot.glitch.me/">www.xopbot.gl</a>. After the suspension of the project <code>APULL.inc</code> started to make <code>XOPPY</code> a search engine that was not very popular compared to the website and was discontinued <a href="https://xoppy.glitch.me/">xoppy.glitch.me/</a>.

<h2>Franchise Expansion</h2>
Although in the beginning of the bot's website the default languages were english and greek, later <code>APULL</code> with help from the CEO and the developer team of <code>XOPBOT</code> were able to make a multilanguage website with every language possibly supported. Since the website had expanded thanks to the version <a href="https://github.com/HACKERPROTM/xopbotsite/commit/4d7b3f581ccfb9cf6088feaca84ab1f840254c94">2.5.0</a> the domains from above were deleted and commited to the domain <a href="https://xopbot.glitch.me">xopbot.glitch.me</a> (current domain) as for the "big idea" of the company, it led it to huge success by the end of 2021 with over nearly 3$ profit daily.

<h2>The Economic Crisis</h2>
In the beginning of 2022 <code>APULL</code> (our former now company) was getting into economic crisis since the company was no longer getting much profit and was slowly falling because there were not many people online as covid had ended for most countries and the third party services were broke, the company returned <code>XOPBOT</code> to its original creators and founders and later shut down since there was no point of paying for services that would not profit anything, so in 13 april 2022 <code>APULL</code> completely stopped funding the company and are now a non-profit company working for 13000+ users on discord :)
